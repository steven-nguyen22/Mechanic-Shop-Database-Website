Authors

## Project Description
Importance/Interest
- This project was interesting to me because I just completed a database class and wanted to implement my skills into a project. Creating a website allowed me to learn the front-end of web developement and combine it with my back-end knowledge of databases learned in class. Developing this website made me become more familiar with languages like HTML, PHP, and Javascript. It also allowed me to improve my SQL skills and basic website styling skills through real life application. 
#### Languages, Tools, Technologies 
- HTML, PHP, Javascript, SQL - Main languages used.  
- Notepad++ - Main editor used.
- PHPMyAdmin - Database used.
#### Input/Output
 - The inputs for this project will be data for the customer, mechanic, car, service request, and closed request tables. The outputs for this project will be the results of this table and futhur queries used to gather specific data.
